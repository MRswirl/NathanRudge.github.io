                <h3>Python Clock</h3>
                <p>As a web developer with a passion for coding, I decided to create a clock in Python. Utilizing my skills in Python and
                my eagerness to learn new concepts, I turned to YouTube and Google for guidance. I found several informative tutorials
                and articles that provided insights into using the tkinter library, a standard GUI toolkit in Python. These resources
                helped me understand the necessary components and functionality needed to build the clock. By combining the knowledge
                gained from these online resources with my existing programming experience, I successfully created a functional and
                visually appealing clock application in Python<p>

                <p>As a web developer and avid coder, I decided to create a Space Invader game in Python. To enhance my skills and tackle
                this project, I turned to YouTube and Google for support. Through various tutorials and guides, I learned how to
                implement game mechanics using Python's pygame library. These resources provided valuable insights into game design,
